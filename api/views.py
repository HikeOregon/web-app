    This is the API endpoint for lists of trails and individual trail details.
    You can use the **Filters** button in the top-right to use the search feature.

    ## A Single Trail

    Get individual trails by using their `id`.  For example, to get the trail
    with `id=1`, use:

        /api/trails/1


    ## Name Search

    To search for trails by name use the `search` parameter.  For example,
    searching for a trail with the word *Lake* in the name:

        /api/trails/?search=Lake

    ## Query Parameter Filtering

    To get all trails with a difficulty of 4:

        /api/trails/?difficulty=4

    To get all trails with a difficulty of 4 and that have a restroom:

        /api/trails/?difficulty=4&restroom=true
